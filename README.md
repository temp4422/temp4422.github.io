Greetings! This is my portfolio. Let me accquintece you with my work ;)

## Philosophy

Trying to [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), while using latest and greatest core web technologies e.g. Web Components, SVG Sprites, ESNext, etc.

## My framework - KISS-x

Use simplest html elements as components and combine them in static pages with simple script.

DX is satisfying, because tend to modular approch with simple components, trying to reapeat modern frameworks e.g. React.
